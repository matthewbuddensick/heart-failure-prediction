# heart-failure-prediction
Predicting heart failure. Implemented in R mainly using the tidyverse and tidymodels libraries.

Performed EDA of variables and then trained and tuned multiple different models to determine which model performed the best. Using a logistic regression model as a baseline, I then tested random forest and XGBoost models to improve model performance.
